This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict water potability based on a set of physicochemical parameters. The goal is to identify safe drinking water sources and guide necessary treatment processes.

## Objective
The primary objective is to predict whether water is potable (safe to drink) using various machine learning techniques. This involves understanding the dataset, preprocessing the data, and experimenting with different models to find the best performance.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Data Splitting**
4. **Modeling**
5. **Model Evaluation**

## Results and Discussion
The project experimented with multiple machine learning models, yielding the following accuracy scores:
- **AdaBoost Classifier**: 95.0%
- **Bagging Classifier**: 95.0%
- **Logistic Regression**: 85.0%
- **SVM**: 85.0%
- **KNN**: 67.0%

AdaBoost and Bagging Classifier outperformed other models, demonstrating significant improvements compared to previous studies. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble methods in predicting water potability.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict water potability, with AdaBoost and Bagging Classifier models achieving the highest accuracy. This work can aid in identifying safe drinking water sources and inform necessary treatment processes to ensure water safety.
